## Methods and Technologies Used
Matplotlib, pandas, Central Tendencies, Linear Regression, Correlation Coefficients

## Conclusions
This analysis examined drug data across 249 mice, both male and female. The study sample was relatively well distributed between sex.

After analyzing the data of different drug treatments used on 249 mice, the treatment that resulted in the lowest tumor volume is Ramicane. Ramicame produced the lowest Mean Tumor Volume, Median Tumor Volume, Tumor Volume Variance, Tumor Volume Std. Dev., Tumor Volume Std. Error suggesting that it is the best treatment of the given drug regimens. Capomulin follows closely behind in compariable results though not as successful as Ramicame.

It is important to note, when comparing the drug treatments Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin, there is a potential outlier in the Infubinol data that could skew the results when evaluting this treatment's effectiveness.

Lastly, there is a strong positive correlation between average mouse weight and average tumor volume, which suggests that as the weight of the mouse increases, so does the tumor volume.
